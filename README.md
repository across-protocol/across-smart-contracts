# @across/contracts

This package contains the contracts for the Across Protocol. They have been audited by Open Zeppelin and tested
thoroughly in automated tests and on mainnet.

Note: they were incubated in a separate repo, so some of the tests and infrastructure have not been moved to this repo
yet. Stay tuned!
